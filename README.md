# Animal products: a young-consumers market analysis

For my BSc thesis in Economics and Statistics, I decided to conduct a market analysis on Italian young people. The project consisted of creating and administering a questionnaire to nearly 200 people regarding their eating habits concerning animal products; subsequently, I extracted significant information through R and presented it in the brief report below.

The main conclusion is that between 2017 and 2022, a major change in the eating habits of the Italian youth population occurred: respondents declared a decline in the consumption of goods of animal origin, compared to a greater openness toward alternative products.
